My solo project will be a track day sign up forum. I will be using React front end and Node + Express backend. 

The website will allow users to create a profile and join track day events. The home page will consist of all upcoming track day events which can be edited or deleted by the creator.  
Each user will create a profile about themselves as well as the car they plan on driving during the event. 
For each track day event, there will be begginner and advanced group to join into. Users trying to join the advanced group must previously have at least 3 track day events to join.

Week 1 Features:
Basic CRUD
Main page will consist of all current races events 
Each race event is a link that will redirect to the display race page consisting of each person in the race. Each person is a link thay will redirectto a display info page.
Will have 2 forms, one for creating race events and another to join them. 

Week 2 Features: 


Product Backlog

I may include a login and register page so only the user can edit/delete their profile or event they initially created.
